## General info

On 🏳️‍🌈 Color switcher page user can change the background color by clicking the "start" button. Color will change every second until the "stop" button will be clicked. 

On ⏰countdown timer page user can set a date click the "start" button so the virtual clock will begin to count down days, hours, minutes and seconds. 

On ✅promise generator page as a name suggest user can create as many promises as he or she wants. 

Working on this repository helped me to learn about asynchronous JS, timeout, interval, dates and promises.
